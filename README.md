# Breast_Cancer_Classification
This project focuses on building a neural network model to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors, contributing to early diagnosis efforts.
Using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, I achieved an impressive 98.25% accuracy!
This project involved: //
✅ Data preprocessing & feature engineering
✅ Standardization for better model performance
✅ Training & evaluating a neural network for accurate predictions
